# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

Aktus AI Platform is an enterprise-grade AI solution for research, knowledge management, and data processing. We take security seriously and are committed to protecting our users' data and maintaining the integrity of our platform.

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to us. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** email us directly at: [security@aktus.ai](mailto:security@aktus.ai)
3. **Include** the following information in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

### What to Expect

- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
- **Acknowledgment**: You'll receive an acknowledgment of your report
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
- **Credit**: Security researchers will be credited in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## üîí Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All data stored in GCS buckets is encrypted using Google Cloud's default encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: All communications use TLS 1.3
- **API Key Security**: API keys are stored as Kubernetes secrets and masked in the UI
- **Workload Identity**: Secure authentication between GKE and Google Cloud services

### Access Control
- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Role-based access control for all cluster resources
- **Service Account Isolation**: Dedicated service accounts for each component
- **Network Policies**: Controlled network access between services
- **GCS Bucket Permissions**: Least-privilege access to storage buckets

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: All images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes ensure service availability
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Key Management**
   - Use strong, unique API keys for OpenAI and Hugging Face
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables or Kubernetes secrets

2. **Network Security**
   - Configure firewall rules appropriately
   - Use static IP addresses for external services
   - Consider using a VPN for additional security

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement least-privilege access
   - Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
   - Regularly review and update access permissions

4. **Data Security**
   - Encrypt sensitive data before upload
   - Use secure file transfer methods
   - Regularly backup important data
   - Implement data retention policies

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Implement input validation

2. **Container Security**
   - Use minimal base images
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
   - Implement security context in deployments
   - Use non-root users when possible

3. **Secret Management**
   - Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
   - Never hardcode secrets in code
   - Implement secret rotation procedures
   - Use external secret management when appropriate

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Logging and Monitoring
- **Application Logs**: All services log security-relevant events
- **Access Logs**: Track authentication and authorization events
- **Error Logs**: Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor for unusual resource usage

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Analysis**: Rapid assessment of security incidents
3. **Containment**: Immediate steps to limit impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove the root cause
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes

## üìã Security Checklist
